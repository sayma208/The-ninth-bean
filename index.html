Our name, The Ninth Bean, reflects our philosophy — every eighth bean may be ordinary, but the ninth is special<br><br>
 It’s the one that stands out with a deeper aroma, a richer flavor, and a touch of magic. That’s what we aim to serve in every cup — something that feels familiar yet unforgettable<br><br>
